*About*

The project is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`]
(https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

It has in-build typescript funtionality 
that protect against type errors for a more robust application. 

The front end components are TypeScript React Native that are responsive, it is 
evident that the app is build in React Native with type support. 

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

2. Note that there is a .env file containing some app variables, you'll
   create your version of it and replace the following variables with your own to run 
   in your development environment. 


3. Start the app

```bash
 npx expo start -c
```

4. After running the command, you'll get a response on your terminal with a QR code you may scan using **Expo** to run the 
   development build on you device. 

5. Use Expo (downloadable from playstore: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=host.exp.exponent&pcampaignid=web_share)
   to run the build on your device.

6. From there just create an account through the sign-up page and login to your created account to get journaling. 

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a:

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).
